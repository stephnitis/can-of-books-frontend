    <h2>Alec Torres</h2>
    <p>After graduating from high school in 2019, Alec Torres decided to attend college at Stony Brook University for 2 years before moving on from it. Alec did not know what to do after that but knew he couldn't sit around and do nothing. After searching for alternatives, Code Fellows seemed to be an answer towards building a foundation for his young adulthood. He's hoping all this hard work pays off and that he can continue to build his life brick-by-brick.
      Alec enjoys reading books, playing video games and playing basketball, but tries to make time to learn something new every day. He can be very competitive and it adds to making any activity he does even more enjoyable.</p>
